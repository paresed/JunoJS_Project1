<p><span id="flavorHi"></span> <span class="designerName"></span>,</p>
<p>
  I am <span id="clientName"></span>, a <span id="clientRole"></span> based in
  <span id="clientCity"></span> and I got your referral from
  <span id="flavorReferral"></span>. My company
  <span id="businessName"></span> has been growing, so we need a new brand
  identity that fits the <span id="businessField"></span> market. We are
  currently a <span id="businessSize"></span> and right now
  <span class="businessAspiration"></span> That's what we need your designs to
  reflect.
</p>
<p>
  I am the sole reviewer for your job, so I thought I'd let you know I am
  <span class="clientMainStyle"></span>,
  <span class="clientSecondaryStyle"></span>. My current hobby is
  <span class="clientHobby"></span>, my favorite color is
  <span class="clientFavColor"></span> and my lucky number is
  <span class="clientNumber"></span>. You don't have to use these, just my fifty
  cents.
</p>
<p>
  For our identity, the stakeholders would like you to use a
  <span class="designColorRule"></span> palette, with
  <span class="designMain"></span> main color(s) and the secondary colors can be
  used freely, but no more than <span class="designSecondary"></span>. If
  possible, use our <span class="designLetters"></span> as you see fit, but we
  suggest a <span class="designFontStyle"></span> font for your work. Think
  "<span class="designTrend"></span>" and things should be fine!
</p>
<p>
  As a first deliverable, I would like you to send me the main logo, as well as
  a <span class="deliverableUI"></span> for our web app and a
  <span class="deliverableMotion"></span>
  for our social media. Feel free to add other elements too, but those listed
  above are must haves.
</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your time, <span class="designerName"></span>!</p>
